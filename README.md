## Hi there 👋

I'm Patrick (@cuiboy), Product Design Intern at GitHub.

📘 I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences). 
📍 I'm originally from Irvine, CA and I'm currently based in San Francisco.
🎨 I self-taught product design when I was 16 when I built my first [app]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUxqTC2_dTk&themeRefresh=1)).
💡 I'm obsessed with ideas and exploring how good ideas solve other people's problems.
📷 I'm a drone photographer & filmmaker outside of work, check out my work [here]((http://instagram.com/patrick.drone)).

Feel free to ping me on Slack @cuiboy for anything and connect with me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/cuipatrick) :)
